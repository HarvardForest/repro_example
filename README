### This is my project
### MK Lau

A useful architecture for projects:

- **README**: file describing the project and associated files
- **data**: folder to collect relevant data files or links
- **src**: where all of the **R** scripts should be kept
- **results**: this is where output from scripts can go
- **docs**: further documentation and relevant files (e.g. notes, papers)
- **bin**: ADVANCED - if you need to include other associated software
